Write a Python program to input the sides of a triangle and check whether the triangle is valid or not.

Note: A triangle is valid if the sum of its two sides is greater than the third side. Means if a, b, c are three sides of a triangle. Then the triangle is valid if all these three conditions are satisfied:

a + b > c a + c > b b + c > a

Edit

Sure, here is a simple Python program that takes the lengths of the sides of a triangle as input and checks if it is a valid triangle or not:


a = int(input("Enter side a: "))
b = int(input("Enter side b: "))
c = int(input("Enter side c: "))

# Check if the triangle is valid
if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
    print("The triangle is valid.")
else:
    print("The triangle is not valid."


    output:

    Enter side a: 6
Enter side b: 9
Enter side c: 5
The triangle is valid
