A library charges a fine for every book returned after the due date.

The rules for calculating the fine are as follows:

2 For the first 5 days after the due date, the fine is 50 paise, for 6-10 days after the due date fine is 1 rupee and for above 10 days after the due date the fine is 5 rupees.

If the book is returned after 30 days beyond the due date the membership will be cancelled.

Write a program to accept the number of days the member is late to return the book and display the fine and/or the appropriate member cancellation message.
Note: If the book is returned on or before the due date print "No fine"

def calculate_library_fine(days_late):
    if days_late <= 0:
        return "No fine"
    elif days_late <= 5:
        fine = days_late * 0.50
    elif days_late <= 10:
        fine = 5 * 0.50 + (days_late - 5) * 1.00
    elif days_late <= 30:
        fine = 5 * 0.50 + 5 * 1.00 + (days_late - 10) * 5.00
    else:
        return "Membership cancelled"

    return f"Fine: Rs. {fine:.2f}"


print(calculate_library_fine(0)) 
print(calculate_library_fine(3))  
print(calculate_library_fine(7))  
print(calculate_library_fine(12)) 
print(calculate_library_fine(35))


output:
No fine
Fine: Rs. 1.50
Fine: Rs. 4.50
Fine: Rs. 17.50
Membership cancelled
