Write a python program for the below scenario:

A company insures its driver in the following cases

I. If the driver is married or

II. If the driver is unmarried, male & above 30 years of age or

III. If the driver is unmarried, female & above 25 years of age.





def is_eligible_for_insurance(gender, age, is_married):
    if is_married:
        return True
    elif gender == 'male' and age > 30:
        return True
    elif gender == 'female' and age > 25:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(is_eligible_for_insurance('male', 35, True))  
print(is_eligible_for_insurance('male', 35, False)) 
print(is_eligible_for_insurance('male', 28, False)) 
print(is_eligible_for_insurance('female', 32, True)) 
print(is_eligible_for_insurance('female', 29, False)) 
print(is_eligible_for_insurance('female', 30, False))
